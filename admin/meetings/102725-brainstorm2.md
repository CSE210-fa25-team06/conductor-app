## Agenda

### Working with Another Team
- Team 7 is available to team up — discussed their previous work  
- Discussed grading scheme and workflow  
- Held a final vote on collaboration  

---

### Team 7 GitHub Setup
- Repository all set up with **Projects**, **Issues**, and **Branching Rules** — added GitHub protection  
- Whenever you work on something, **create an Issue** — must raise a PR to merge code  
- Requires **two code reviews** before merging into main:  
  - 1 from the same sub-team  
  - 1 from a different team  
- Added GitHub workflow with issues and project boards to track all tasks  
  - Task title, description, feature (frontend/backend/documentation), sprint management, and status (to-do/in progress/done)  
  - Added **user stories** to clarify user expectations  
- Discussed enforcing stand-ups — possibly through a Slack bot  
- Push to main as soon as a feature is complete or shows good progress  
- Ensure code passes all linters before merging  

**Definition of Done:**  
Code is complete, reviewed, passes all checks, and merged into main

### Project 1 Discussion
- Starting Pitch Check-in  
- No coding until pitch is approved  
- Meeting scheduled for tomorrow after class with the TA  
- Reviewed roles and who is working on which features  
- Feature 1 identified as the most time-consuming  
- Brainstormed ideas for how to implement each feature  
- Created rough **database sketch**  
- Drafted **homepage sketch** following provided wireframe  

---

## To Dos
- Each team: make changes to the **database** with data fields needed for their feature  
- Each team: update the **Figma** design to show how their feature should look  
- Refine their section in the **spec document**  
- Fill out the section on **Starting Pitch Check-in**  

---

## Q&A
- Discussed the **test-driven development (TDD)** cycle and writing our own test cases  
  - Might be overkill, but we can test individual features with **unit tests**  
  - For **integration testing**, a dedicated testing team is needed
